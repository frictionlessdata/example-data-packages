# About the Open Data Day Tweets Data Package

[The 7th International Open Data Day](http://opendataday.org) was marked on March 3, 2018. On the day, people used the [#opendataday](https://twitter.com/hashtag/OpenDataDay) and [#odd18](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ODD18) hashtags to share insights from over 400 community events.

This data package contains three resources:

- a [stripped-down version](data/subsetofopendatadaytweets.csv) of the tweets data, in line with [Twitter's Developer Policy](https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/policy.html)
- a [datapackage.json](datapackage.json) file with schema and metadata
- an [R script](scripts/opendataday.R) used to mine Open Data Day tweets via the Twitter Search API
- a [simple map](docs/geotagged_tweets.png) generated from the analysis of tweets with geotagged information
